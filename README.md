# RandomWalkingExample
Two Dimensional Self Avoiding Random Walk 

This is an example of a two dimensional self avoiding random walk. A random walker will be spawned anywhere you click. The speed of the walkers can be controlled by a slider at the bottom of the window. A button can be selected that will spawn random walkers at random positions.The Spawn frequency can be adjusted with a slider at the bottom of the window. Blocks that the walkers will avoid are also spawned at random positions. Abutton exists that will change the placement of the blocks. The blocks can be moved but only once. The place they are picked up from is also avoided by the walkers. This would be a good demonstration for a computational physics class.
